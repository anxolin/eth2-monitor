  # It will notify when the check fails by this numnber of times in a row. The highest will define the periodicity 
  # after that number is reached
  #
  #   i.e  [15, 60, 1440], and assuming a polling_wait of 60 seconds
  #       - Notify after 15 failures, so it will notify after 15min failing
  #       - Notify after 60min
  #       - Notify after 24h (and every 24h from this moment)
